3. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
4. OAuth 2.0
5. Flask
6. SQLAlchemy
7. [Catalog repository](https://github.com/WidyaPuspitaloka/Catalog.git)

### Setup
* Download and isntall Python 2 (if you have not already)
* Download and install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (the link is provided by Udacity)
* Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (the link is provided by Udacity)
* Clone or download, then unzip VM configuration, [fullstack-nanodegree-vm](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm ) provided by Udacity
* Clone or download [this repository](https://github.com/WidyaPuspitaloka/Catalog.git) into `vagrant` directory

### Usage
Starting virtual machine 
* From your terminal, go to a new directory containing the VM files
* Inside, you will find another directory called `vagrant`. Change directory to the `vagrant` directory
* Inside the vagrant subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up` to download the Linux operating system and install it
* Then, to log in to the installed Linux VM, run `vagrant ssh`
* Inside the VM, change directory to `/vagrant` and look around with `ls` command.

Set up a Google authorization application
* Go to https://console.developers.google.com/project and login with Google.
* Create a new project
* Name the project
* Choose Credentials from the menu on the left.
* Create an OAuth Client ID.
* Configure the consent screen
* Click create client ID
* In Authorized javascript origins add://localhost:5000
* Click download JSON and save it into the same directory as  this project.
* Rename the JSON file "client_secrets.json"
* In main.html replace the line "data-clientid="xxxx" so that it uses your Client ID from the web applciation.

Loading the data
* Unzip the [cloned repository](https://github.com/WidyaPuspitaloka/Catalog.git), place the folder in the same directory as the `VagrantFile` file inside `vagrant`.
* From your terminal, go to a new directory containing the cloned repository
* Run `python database_setup.py` to create the database.
* Run `python coldplaydiscography.py` to add the song and album items

Running the script
* Inside the `vagrant` directory in the VM, go to a new directory containing the [cloned repository](https://github.com/WidyaPuspitaloka/Catalog.git)
* Run `$ python finalproject.py` to execute the program and to look at the database
* Open your webbrowser and visit http://localhost:5000/

### Expected Functionality
* Without log in, users only can see public pages
* Users can login / logout with Google account.
* Logged in users can add, edit and delete their own album and song.
* Can access JSON data
